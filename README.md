# FraudGuard: Intelligent Credit Card Fraud Detection


We have design the system using Machine Learning with python for Credit Card Fraud Detection.Here we have used the Logistic Regression model.

## Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset of form CSV file, which consist of credit card details such as legit transaction & furdulent transaction.


## Technologies Used
The following libraries have been used in the implementation of this model:

1. Numpy
2. Panda
3. Logistic Regression

## Implementation
We start with the data exploration and analysis.Then select the relevant feature for feature selection such as time,legit transaction,furdulent transaction.
Then seperate data for analysis on the basis of legit transaction & furdulent transaction.Afterwards,we compare the value for both transactions.
